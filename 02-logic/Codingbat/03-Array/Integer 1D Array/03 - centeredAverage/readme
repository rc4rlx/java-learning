Array-2 > centeredAverage


Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, 
except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value,
ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.


centeredAverage([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3
centeredAverage([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5
centeredAverage([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) → -3


my message
  so for this problem it went so hard cause as you can see my raw version is so different to clean version its like my rawversion is so overkill because i used two for loops where in fact i can just solve it simple by adding all and storing it to sum
  and subtracting the largest and smallest to the problem and subtracting 2 to array length to compute the final average yeah i will not stop learning, this phase of where i am right now is overkilling problems using so many syntax, 
  so that's it for this day, im going to study bfs and dijkstra algorithm now
