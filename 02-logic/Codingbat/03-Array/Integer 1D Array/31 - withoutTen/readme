Array-2 > withoutTen

Return a version of the given array where all the 10s have been removed. 
The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, 
and the empty spaces a the end of the array should be 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}. 
You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.


withoutTen([1, 10, 10, 2]) → [1, 2, 0, 0]
withoutTen([10, 2, 10]) → [2, 0, 0]
withoutTen([1, 99, 10]) → [1, 99, 0]

My Explanation and Learnings: 

  Soo i created a new array and int n and the length of arr is equal to nums.length and what i did
was if nums[i] == 10 i will store it to arr[n] and increment n, its like n is the counter for arr
  so every array index of arr will have correct amount so yeah it was not that hard but its not the best solution 
as chatgpt told me when i compare my solution to the optimize one so i was thinking of learning how 
time complexity and space complexity works maybe it will help me come up with a better solution for the problemsss

my eyes is on time complexity i will learn that if it will help me improve my problem solving skills
