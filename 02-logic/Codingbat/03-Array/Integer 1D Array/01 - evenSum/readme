Array-2 > countEvens

Return the number of even ints in the given array. Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 5 % 2 is 1.


countEvens([2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) → 3
countEvens([2, 2, 0]) → 3
countEvens([1, 3, 5]) → 0


my learnings: 

  this problem is easy its like maybe a warmup in codingbat array-2 yeah my answer is in mainfile
  i learned nothing cause im already familiar to modulus operator i just used it to find the values that is even number in array
