Array-2 > zeroFront


Return an array that contains the exact same numbers as the given array, 
but rearranged so that all the zeros are grouped at the start of the array. 
The order of the non-zero numbers does not matter. So {1, 0, 0, 1} becomes {0 ,0, 1, 1}. 
You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.


zeroFront([1, 0, 0, 1]) → [0, 0, 1, 1]
zeroFront([0, 1, 1, 0, 1]) → [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
zeroFront([1, 0]) → [0, 1]

hey theree, i was absent since dec 3rd to dec7th cause i was so busy in our program presentation, its about dijkstra shortest path and now im back, i speedrun array1 and array2 03-30 today, yeah but not totally speedrun, some problem took me 1hr to answer it and some is few mins only..

soo heres my explanation for this problem when i was solving the problem it came to my mind the auto sort but i only watched them visually on yt 
so i think how to apply it and this logic took me 30 mins and i was able to answer it 
but chatgpt said its overkilled but still i was able to solve it even if this is not the optimize answer fk it im still pushing this on github, big progress...lets go🔥
