Array-2 > evenOdd


Return an array that contains the exact same numbers as the given array, 
but rearranged so that all the even numbers come before all the odd numbers. 
Other than that, the numbers can be in any order. You may modify and return the given array, 
or make a new array.


evenOdd([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]) → [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
evenOdd([3, 3, 2]) → [2, 3, 3]
evenOdd([2, 2, 2]) → [2, 2, 2]


and saaaame for this one ahahaa, logic is not really hard when i solved it its like swapping values from start to end
using the even odd checker so yeah i made sure that the even will be the first and odds number will be the last.
