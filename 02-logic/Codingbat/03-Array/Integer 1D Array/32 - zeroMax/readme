Array-2 > zeroMax


Return a version of the given array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value 
to the right of the zero in the array. If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, 
leave the zero as a zero.


zeroMax([0, 5, 0, 3]) → [5, 5, 3, 3]
zeroMax([0, 4, 0, 3]) → [3, 4, 3, 3]
zeroMax([0, 1, 0]) → [1, 1, 0]

my solution to this problem is same approach, i was able to come up a solution on my own without help of ai but its not
the best solution when it comes to time complexity
